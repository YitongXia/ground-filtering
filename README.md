# ground-filtering algorithms

This project contains two 3D point cloud ground filtering algorithms based on CGAL implementation:
    1. Ground filtering with TIN refinement
    2. Cloth simulation filter algorithm
    
The TIN refinement algorithm is done by me and the CSF algorithm is done by Fengyan Zhang(zmocheng@gmail.com).
